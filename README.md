# Telecom-ETL-Using-SSIS

This project uses fake datasets related to the field of communication (such as IMSI / IMEI / TAC / SNR), but I would like to highlight this project that reviews concepts and topics that can be applied in any other project, and the part of the field of Tele-communication in this series is extremely limited.
  Extract Data from CSV files.
  Process and transfer data.
  Dealing with data that do not meet the quality requirements like Nulls and missing values.
  Error Handling
  Archive files that have been processed and transferred.
  Auditing the processed data.
